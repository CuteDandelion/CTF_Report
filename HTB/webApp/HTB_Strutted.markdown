## Executive Summary
This report details the results of a penetration test conducted on a HTB Capture The Flag (CTF) environment. The objective was to identify and exploit vulnerabilities to capture flags and assess the security of the target systems. 

---

## Introduction
### Objective
The goal of this pentest was to simulate real-world attacks on a home CTF setup to capture flags and identify security weaknesses.

### Scope
- **Targets**: Linux box (10.129.231.200), web server(10.129.231.200:80) => strutted.htb (domain)
- **Testing Type**: Black-box (no prior knowledge) 
- **Constraints**: Testing conducted within a virtualized home lab; no external network access.

---

## Methodology
The pentest followed a structured approach based on CTF best practices:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Identified active hosts and services using tools like Nmap.
2. **Enumeration**: Probed for open ports, services, and application details.
3. **Exploitation**: Attempted to exploit vulnerabilities to gain access or capture flags.
4. **Post-Exploitation**: Escalated privileges or pivoted to other systems (if applicable).
5. **Reporting**: Documented findings with evidence.

**Tools Used**:
- Nmap (network scanning)
- Caido / BurpSuite (web application testing)
- Manual scripting (Python, Bash)

## Findings and Vulnerabilities (Exploitation)

### Finding 1: CVE-2024-53677 (apache struts - RCE)
- **MITRE**: T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application), T1059.004 (Command and Scripting Interpreter-Unix shell)
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Location**: Web server (10.129.231.200:80), /upload.action;jsessionid={sessid} endpoint
- **Description**: File upload logic in Apache Struts is flawed. An attacker can manipulate file upload params to enable paths traversal and under some circumstances this can lead to uploading a malicious file which can be used to perform Remote Code Execution.
- **Evidence**: 
![CVE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfe8a515-631d-4227-b831-51617d769ee5)
![webshell](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0810e478-59b8-446b-b658-d3dd8d4eb92a)

- **Impact**: Exposure of sensitive system information, gaining unauthorized initial access.
- **Recommendation**: Patch --> advised to upgrade to Apache Struts 6.4.0 or later and migrate to the new file upload mechanism. 


### Finding 2: TBA

---


## Conclusion (TBA)
The pentest successfully identified [X] vulnerabilities in the home CTF environment, with [Y] flags captured. Critical issues, such as SQL injection, pose significant risks and should be addressed immediately. By implementing the recommended remediations, the CTF setup can be made more secure and educational for future practice.
